**Q5: Can I transfer both jobs and views at the same time?**
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you can transfer both jobs and views, but they need to be done separately by specifying the `ftype` parameter in the `transfer` function.

**Q6: How do I handle plugin dependencies?**
-------------------------------------------
You can use the `check_and_install_plugin_dependencies` function to automatically check and install missing dependencies.

.. tip::

    It is recommended to run the plugin checks before transferring jobs to avoid failures.

**Q7: What does the 'quiet' mode do?**
--------------------------------------
The `quiet` mode suppresses all non-error messages, making the output less verbose. Use `mode="quiet"` if you want to minimize console output.
